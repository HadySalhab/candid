- Maximum capactity that can be held in the vending machine is 100
- Cans can only be added when restocking
- No limitations for the number of cans per flavour

- Shared: includes multi-instances objects: utilities,validators, custom widgets, custom controls, etc.
- Core: includes single-instance objects (Singleton): store, store actions, store selectors, etc.
